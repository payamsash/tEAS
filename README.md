## Modulating Altered Sensory Prediction in Tinnitus Using Bilateral Auditory Cortex HD-tRNS and Acoustic Masking

Background: Combining acoustic and transcranial (electric) stimulation represents a promising avenue for both basic research and clinical applications. 
It offers a novel way to explore and harness neuroplasticity in the auditory system, potentially leading to more effective treatments for tinnitus and other auditory disorders.
Neuromodulatory techniques have shown promise but require further exploration to establish efficacy and mechanisms.

Objective: This study evaluated the effectiveness of bilateral low-frequency high-definition transcranial random noise stimulation (lf-tRNS) combined with acoustic stimulation (AS) over Heschl's gyrus in modulating auditory evoked potentials and reducing tinnitus perception. 
We hypothesized that bimodal stimulation would be more effective than unimodal stimulation and/or sham conditions for these purposes.

Methods: This double-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 13 individuals with chronic tinnitus. 
Participants underwent lf-tRNS alone, combined lf-tRNS and AS, and corresponding sham conditions in a single-session, crossover within-subject design.
The primary outcomes were the modulation of sensory prediction in auditory evoked potentials and changes in objective loudness of a white noise masker to cover the tinnitus (minimum masking level) after stimulation.
Further clinical outcomes were subjective tinnitus loudness and distress, assessed via visual analogue scales.

\noindent Results:  On the brain level, there were significant modulations in auditory evoked potentials after both electric (tRNS) and bimodal (tRNS + AS) stimulation but not in their sham homologs.
Furthermore, bimodal stimulation (tRNS + AS) and bimodal-sham stimulation (tRNS-sham + AS-sham) significantly reduced objective loudness by more than 3dB.

\noindent Conclusion: The findings suggest that lf-tRNS, particularly when combined with AS, effectively modulates auditory processing and may reduce tinnitus symptoms when applied as treatment. 
Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and underlying mechanisms after multiple-sessions.
